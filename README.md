Create a RoR application that keeps track of courses and sections for a university. A course has many sections, and a section belongs to a single course.

Course data should include the following.

    Name
    Department
    Number
    Credit hours

Section data should include the following.

    Semester
    Number
    Course
    Room number

In the form for a section, have a drop-down with a list of possible courses. For extra credit, modify the CSS for your application to make it look better.

Please write a paper about what you did.
